# Code of Conduct

This project follows the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct.

## Our pledge

We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality,
personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Harassment, trolling, insulting or derogatory comments
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement

To report a conduct issue, please open an issue and clearly mark it as a **Code of Conduct**
report. If the repository is hosted on GitHub, you may also use GitHub's built-in reporting tools.

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards and will take appropriate action in
response to unacceptable behavior.
